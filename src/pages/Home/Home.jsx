            I finished a class of User Experience Design (UXD) from Informal
            School of IT, I have graphic design experience, and a strong
            technical background, beeing a graduate of the Technical University
            of Cluj napoca (UTCN). I am a creative person and have a lot of
            attention to details. I like to participate at brainstorming
            sessions, I like to generate new ideas and make sketches, and I
            believe in my ability of solving problems. I think team work is a
            must in order for a team to succeed and to advance towards succes.
